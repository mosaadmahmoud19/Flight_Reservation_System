# Flight Reservation System
---
The Flight Reservation System is a C++ project showcasing flight booking and management capabilities between different cities. Utilizing Dijkstra's algorithm, it efficiently finds optimal routes for users based on time and cost. Two-dimensional arrays represent flight durations and ticket prices, facilitating seamless search and booking functionalities. The system also enables cancellation and displays booked tickets for users. This project demonstrates my proficiency in C++ programming, data structures, and algorithms, offering an intuitive user interface for a real-world flight reservation system.

Data Structures and Algorithms:

Two-Dimensional Arrays: Represent flight durations and costs, enabling quick access to flight information for route calculation.

Dijkstra's Algorithm: Used to find the most time-efficient and cost-effective flight routes, ensuring optimal choices for users.

Linked List: Employed to manage booked tickets, facilitating efficient insertion and deletion operations for reservations.

The chosen data structures, like two-dimensional arrays, provide a structured way to store and access flight information, enhancing the system's efficiency in searching and booking flights. Additionally, Dijkstra's algorithm is ideal for finding the shortest paths between cities, providing users with optimal routes. The use of linked lists for ticket management optimizes memory usage and ensures smooth handling of reservations. These data structures and algorithms were carefully selected to create a robust and user-friendly flight reservation system.
